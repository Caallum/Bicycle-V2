## Replit Support

To get started, go into replit and then clone the github repo 

After doing this, head to src/config.js then change `"replit": false,` to `"replit": true,`

This will now allow you to add your token and mongo uri to the env variables instead of the config. This is mainly for safety reasons.

Any issues and please raise a ticket. Everything should be operational.

## Reporting Issues

First head to the "Issues" tab on the github, then from there make a new issue. Then please follow the following format:
```
What is your issue?:

What does it show inside your terminal?:
```

*This is only for issues with the bot, not issuing with starting it and this will only cover issues that occured when you HAVE NOT editted the code at all (apart from the config.js)*
